I did not upload the engine code because I was unsure how the creator of the engine would feel about that.
If you want, you can download the engine code from this link: https://dominoclub.itch.io/sssm-in-the-shadow-of-jupiter
replace the .html file with this one and you can run the game locally without the assets.
